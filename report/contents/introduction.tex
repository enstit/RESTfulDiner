\subsection{An Open Data API System}

\begin{frame}{The Problem}
	In a far away land, there is a restaurant that is serving every day
	thousands of hungry customers. The restaurant owner needs a system to keep
	track of all the orders that are coming in, and that can also help him to
	analyze the data in order to improve the service that he is offering to his
	customers.

	The restaurant owner understands that the data that he is collecting is very
	valuable, and he wants to make it available to the public, so that other
	willing Data Scientists can help him to improve his	business.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Solution}
	The solution of the problem is to design a system that can handle the
	restaurant orders data, and that can also provide an API to access the data
	in a simple and efficient way.

	In a few words, an \textbf{Open Data API system} is exactly what the
	restaurant owner needs.
